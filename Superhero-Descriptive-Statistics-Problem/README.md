### Project Overview

 The project is to find out descriptive statistics about the superhero dataset and try to infer the spread, dispersion, covariance etc


### Learnings from the project

 I learnt how and when to apply which type of measures of central tendency, how to view the dispersion of data and how to get inferences from it.
It helps to understand the data better with help of plots and values


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 I used matplotlib for visualization and python and pandas inbuilt methods to calculate the mean, median,mode, std deviation , corelation, standard deviation etc..
